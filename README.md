# Hikvision Time-Lapse Video Generator
This script downloads all video files for a given date (default yesterday)
and creates a time-lapse video from them.  It was written for a Mac running
macOS Mojave with homebrew ffmpeg installed.  For other systems YMMV.

You will need to edit the top five lines to match your camera installation.
